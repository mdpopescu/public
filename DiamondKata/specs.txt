# The Diamond Kata

Given a character from the alphabet, print a diamond of its output with that character being the midpoint of the diamond.

Examples

    > diamond.exe A
      A

    > diamond.exe B
       A
      B B
       A

    > diamond.exe C
        A
       B B
      C   C
       B B
        A

## Hints

It may be helpful visualise the whitespace in your rendering like this:

    > diamond.exe C
    _ _ A _ _
    _ B _ B _
    C _ _ _ C
    _ B _ B _
    _ _ A _ _

## Notes:

- the letter will be coverted to its uppercase equivalent
- only ASCII letters will be considered (no diacritics, emoji or anything else)
- anything outside of the A to Z interval will be ignored
- multiple characters will also be ignored



// taking spaces into account, the result will be a square
// the length of the square would be N*2-1, with N being
// equal to ch-'A'+1

var n = ch - 'A' + 1;
var len = n * 2 - 1;
